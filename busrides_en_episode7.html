                The world has undergone disruptive change in the last decades, driven by exponential advances in digital
                technologies. Our cars not only listen, but respond. Our banks approve online mortgage applications in
                minutes. Our favourite pizza joints let us track our pies from oven to door in real time. The ripple
                effects of this digital revolution are both incredible and indiscriminate, and no nook or cranny of our
                society has been left untouched—including government.
                <br><br>
                In fact, this brave new world poses some very real challenges to governments the world over, and while
                the right response isn’t necessarily to start “moving fast and breaking things,” we just as certainly
                can’t stand still. The digital future is here, and we must move from reluctantly reacting to proactively
                engaging if we are to meet the expectations of those we serve.
                <br><br>
                What exactly does this mean?
                <br><br>
                First, the digital revolution is inextricable from the technology that drives it. As such, it will
                evidently mean changes in government tools and systems. This transformation will help establish the IT
                backbone needed to deliver the services Canadians expect: simple, modern and digitally enabled,
                available anytime, anywhere, from any device.
                <br><br>
                Yet digital government is far more than modern websites and optical fibres, sophisticated algorithms and
                flashy apps. In fact, many leaders in the digital government space argue that it’s not even primarily
                about the tech.
                <br><br>
                Rather, the more transformative change is the digital revolution’s rewrite of how we “do government,”
                soup to nuts. Because doing digital right means putting the needs of those we serve at the centre of all
                we do, rather than continuing to privilege organizational silos or institutional convenience. It means
                conceding that we rarely know what the future holds, but instead need the permission and the space to
                fail fast, change course and improve over time. It means designing our services for the hardest-to-reach
                users first, not last. It means recognizing the data we collect for the asset it is and stewarding it
                accordingly. And it means humbly admitting that we don’t have all the answers, nor are we alone in the
                service delivery space. Instead, we must work in the open as digital allies, forging partnerships across
                branches, departments, jurisdictions and sectors, and learning from one another’s successes and
                failures.
                <br><br>
                In short, it means realizing the vision of digital government requires many of us to work very
                differently than we do today. The growing pains will be real—and it is still the right thing to do.
                Canadians deserve our efforts.
                <br><br>
                Where do we start?
                <br><br>
                We start by establishing a common understanding of what “good” looks like in the digital age—and that’s
                where the Digital Standards come in.
                <br><br>
                As the name implies, these ten evergreen principles set the standard for how government will work in the
                digital age in the name of improved service delivery. Imported and adapted from digital leaders at home
                and abroad[1] and refined in the open to reflect our Canadian context, the Standards were announced by
                the President of the Treasury Board and Minister for Digital Government in September 2018. Including
                such tenets as designing with users, iterating frequently and working in the open, these principles are
                designed to help us “do government differently” by aligning our actions towards our shared digital
                vision. Concretely, they also serve as the yardsticks by which we will weigh service delivery options,
                measure performance, make decisions and prioritize activities. And, as the experiences of our digital
                forebears have proven, they empower the change agents, at all levels, who are living this paradigm
                today, while paving the way for everyone to embrace it tomorrow.
                <br><br>
                Transforming government for the digital age is a tall order. The good thing is, it’s our shared
                challenge—and we’re not starting from scratch. Many among our ranks have been blazing the trails towards
                the digital good for years by embodying the principles underpinning our Digital Standards. Meanwhile,
                initiatives like the Digital Academy are laying the foundation for every public servant to develop the
                skills, knowledge and competencies we need to follow suit.
                <br><br>
                The time has come for us all to join the digital government revolution. Who’s with me?
                <br><br>
                [1] See for example the digital standards and principles the British, American, Australian, New Zealand
                and Ontario governments have established.
